# GoodClownBadClown
A VR game, consisting of carnival minigames. Work in progress.

The current console for this game is the Meta Quest 2.

The user will play a series of minigames, which when completed, will allow the user to enter the final round and locate clown heads to add to an alter.

The minigames can be played in any order and currently consist of:

Duck Shooting
Nose Tag
Clean Up Duty

Duck Shooting:
The aim is to shoot the targets located in the level, which consists of rubber ducks, balloons and targets.
The right, rear trigger is used to shoot the gun, which is located in the right hand.
Using spatial audio, the rubber ducks produce audio as they move about the waterways and each object will make a sound when they are shot. Additionally, each time
the gun is shot, it will also produce a sound from the gun's nozzle.

Nose Tag:
The aim is for the user to tap a certain number of clown noses, which are only active when an auditory noise is played from that clown head, indicating
it needs to be that specific one. Using spatial audio, the user can pin-point which specific head it is.
When the user has tagged a certain number of noses, the level will end.
Aside from movement, there is no real need for buttons to be used on the controllers, as the tag works through hand-to-nose collision.

Clean Up Duty:
The aim for this minigame is for the user to cleanup a certain area of the carnvial (toilet area) by collecting poop which has been
scattered around the level. The user will collect it and put it into the toilet.
The user can use their left or right rear trigger to pick up the poop and move it into the toilet, using colliders to destroy the poo objects.

Haunted Swamp:
This level is still a work in progress. The aim is for the user to collect different clown heads and put them on an alter, removing the curse from the swamp
and saving the carnival from the evil clown.
